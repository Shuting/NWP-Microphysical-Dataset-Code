# NWP-Microphysical-Dataset-Code
Code for a NWP microphysical parameterization dataset for improving precipitation prediction via machine learning

## Download a little dataset including training and test datasets
run "Run01_main.py" file

## Descriptions of each file:
1.	Fun01_Dataset.py including functions for generating training and test datasets from the original mat files
2.	Fun02_Model,py build a 1DD-CNN regression model for simulating NWP model microphysical parameterization scheme
3.	Fun03_Experiment.py including functions for training and testing a model and analyzing results
4.	Run01_main.py a main file to create, train, and test the model.
